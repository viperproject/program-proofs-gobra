# program-proofs-gobra
Examples and exercises from the book [*Program Proofs*](https://program-proofs.com/) by Rustan Leino translated to Go and verified with [Gobra](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/gobra.html).

## Repository Structure
For each chapter of the book that we cover, we have a separate package.
In each package, there are two kinds of files depending on their names:
- files named `examples_X.Y.gobra` contain the examples from section `X.Y` of the book.
- files named `exercises_X.Y.gobra` contain the solutions to the exercises from section `X.Y`
  of the book, **not** the solution to exercise `X.Y`.

## Current Status
So far, we have translated the examples and exercises from Part 0 and are in the process of translating those from Part 1 and 2. These will be added gradually to this repository.
